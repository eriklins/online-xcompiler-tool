# Online XCompiler Tool

## Simple Frontend for Laird's SmartBASIC Online XCompiler
Laird's online xcompiler lives at http://uwterminalx.no-ip.org/ and offers online compiling of SmartBASIC applications for different SmartBASIC driven Bluetooth modules and SmartBASIC firmware versions, even some which are not supported by the UwTerminalX application. However, it can only compile a single file and does not support #include statements, which are commonly used in SmartBASIC code.

The Online XCompiler Tool supports this and can compile SmartBASIC files \#include'ing other SmartBASIC files. The new Auto-Compile mode continously monitors the source file and all included files and starts compilation as soon as one of the files has been changed.

It can run under Windows 32 and 64 bit as well as Linux 32 and 64 bit.

On startup it loads the web page from the original URL and grabs devices and firmware versions from the HTML code and populates into the drop down boxes. After selecting a SmartBASIC source code file pressing XCompile button will invoke the online XCompiler and compile. On success it will save the compiled .uwc file to the same location from where the source file was loaded. On error the log output window will show the compiler error message.

## Build Tool
The Online XCompiler Tool was written with [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/index.php) / [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/). The project and full source code are available in the src folder.

## Releases
